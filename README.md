# Heart-Disease-Risk-Assessment: 
# A-Comparative-Analysis-of-Multiple-Machine-Learning-Models.

This was my Undergrad Final year project. This project is end to end full stack data science application. 
We have developed a heart disease risk assessment system that utilizes multiple machine learning models, including SVM, logistic regression, Bernoulli naive Bayes, and Random Forest. We conducted a comparative study on the performance of these models. Moreover, we deployed the models using Flask, Bootstrap, and Heroku to create a user-friendly web application that allows easy access to the heart disease risk assessment system.
This project has unlocked the journey into data science field. This helped me to pursue my career in data science.
